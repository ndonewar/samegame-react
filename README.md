# SameGame

One night about 10 years ago (early 2008), I threw together a quick implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SameGame" target="_blank">SameGame</a>. It's a tile-matching puzzle game I played (too much) on Windows 95.

I recently found the files again. The code wasn't ideal, but the game was playable. I thought it might be fun to revisit it.

I initially refactored the <a href="https://github.com/ndonewar/samegame-jquery">jQuery version</a>, but then decided to build and add to it using React (this repo).
